   ACH50
      Air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure.
   
   API
      Application Programming Interface. An API is a documented way for 
      different software to interact with each other. In the context of this
      document, the API referred to specifically is the :term:`HEScore` API. 
      Specific documentation is available on the 
      `LBNL website <https://developers.buildingsapi.lbl.gov/hescore>`_.
   
   CFM50
      Cubic feet per minute at 50 Pascals pressure.
   
   HEScore
      Home Energy Scoring Tool. The Home Energy Score is similar to a vehicle's 
      mile-per-gallon rating. The Home Energy Score allows homeowners to 
      compare the energy performance of their homes to other homes nationwide. 
      It also provides homeowners with suggestions for improving their homes' 
      efficiency. The process starts with a Home Energy Score Qualified Assessor 
      collecting energy information during a brief home walk-through. Using the 
      Home Energy Scoring Tool, developed by the Lawrence Berkeley National 
      Laboratory, the Qualified Assessor then scores the home on a scale of 
      1 to 10. A score of 10 indicates that the home has excellent energy 
      performance. A score of 1 indicates the home needs extensive energy 
      improvements. In addition to providing the Score, the Qualified Assessor 
      provides the homeowner with a list of recommended energy improvements and 
      the associated cost savings estimates. [#f3]_

   HPXML
      Home Performance :term:`XML`. BPI-2100 is designed to facilitate communication 
      and the exchange of information and data 
      among all actors in the home performance industry by providing an extensible mark-up 
      language (XML) standard for transferring information related to whole-house energy efficiency 
      upgrades. The standard is informally known as Home Performance XML, or HPXML. 
      BPI-2100 is a companion standard to BPI-2200 (Standard for Home Performance-Related Data 
      Collection). Each of the data elements defined in BPI-2200 can be transferred via HPXML. [#f2]_
      
   XML
      eXtensible Markup Language. XML is a markup language that defines a set of 
      rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and 
      machine-readable. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by 
      the W3C, and several other related specifications, all free open 
      standards. [#f1]_
