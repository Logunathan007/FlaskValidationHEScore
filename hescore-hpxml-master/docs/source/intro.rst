Introduction

:term:`HPXML` is a flexible way to transfer home energy audit and retrofit data
via a standardized schema. This flexibility, one if its greatest strengths, is also
a weakness. Home Energy Score (:term:`HEScore`) requires very specific data points
to be reported as inputs to the :term:`API`. Many of those data points can be 
represented in the :term:`HPXML` syntax in multiple ways due to the flexibility 
of the standard. The purpose of this guide is to document the assumptions that 
are made in the translation of :term:`HPXML` data elements into :term:`HEScore`
software inputs.
